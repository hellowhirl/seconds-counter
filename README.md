Are you a good a human seconds counter? Then try your hand at this game and see how close you can get to counting a second!

Each time you press the 'spacebar' you will get a reading on the current time and how close you came (in percentage) to counting a second. If you come within 10% of a millisecond than you will receive a "Great!" rating. Within 30% and you will get a "Good" rating. Anything outside of that is "Bad."
